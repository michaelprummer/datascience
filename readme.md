### Getting started with bootstrap

Grunt is needed to generate css and js files automatically. Grunt will be installed locally with `npm install`

`grunt dist`
Regenerates the /dist/ directory with compiled and minified CSS and JavaScript files. As a Bootstrap user, this is normally the command you want.

`grunt watch
Watches the Less source files and automatically recompiles them to CSS whenever you save a change.
